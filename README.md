# board

This is just me practicing some Clojure on the problem of finding words on a board. Hopefully the code is self-explanatory. 

I have been using this small example to practice writing more idiomatic Clojure code. If you stumble on this and have comments, I'd be grateful to hear them. 

## Usage

`lein test` runs a few tests that show how to use it.
